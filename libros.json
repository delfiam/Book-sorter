   "My Review": "naomi novik we knew you wanted to make a trilogy you didn't have to make us go through an infodumping nothing at all is happening.txt to make it happen!!!<br/><br/>Seriously, this book was so dull. Nothing was happening. Most of the stuff in this book are forgettable and, the ones that are not (El killing a maw-mouth and the repair of the machinery) go knowhere. The only thing I'd put as the main plot of the story (the repair of the machinery) happens by the end of the book and it solves in one chapter?? For such a slow book the ending sure is rushed!<br/><br/>This was CLEARLY an introductory book to make us buy the sequel. All this stuff or most could've happened with El being in her last year and the stakes being even higher and it'd have been much more interesting!! Instead, we have El explaining us every single detail of the magic system so we can remember it for the second book.<br/><br/>The characters except Aadhya have no personality at all and I couldn't understand most of their actions?? Especially El's. She switched up personalities and opiniones every 5 pages.<br/> <br/>Lastly, the book is sold awfully. My spanish edition synopsis is all focused on El wanting to kill Orion except she wanted that for like 2 pages and then they became friends so ?? why. While this synopsis talks about El's possibility to kill her classmates due to her power except... that never happens. No one gets in danger because of El. I don't know... the marketing of this book is so weird. I should stop listening to BookTok.",

   "My Review": "Man, this made me feel so good.<br/><br/>It was such an enjoyable reading, specially the second half. It's been a while since a book made me externalize my reactions; I laughed out loud, I got (very) excited everytime Seth and Nick would do . anything and I tried my best to hold back tears. I really loved it.<br/><br/>The first half was a bit hard to go through, sometimes I'd jokingly ask myself if this book was adhd-friendly. It wasn't because it was boring, but because I just finished a fantasy book so going from killing monsters to seeing a kid being obsessed with superheroes and not that much happening was a change, but a lovely one once I got used to it.<br/><br/>I think what I can most highlight about this book is its character building. Nick is hilarious and self aware and I loved his relationship with his dad so much. Nick very similar to me and I loved sending my friend quotes of him I could relate to.<br/><br/>I would love to see more of Jazz and Gabby because god those little lesbians stole my entire heart. Jazz's so smart and strong and Gabby is so caring and responsible, they truly make the perfect pair and are on their way to be one of my favorite book couples.<br/><br/>I laughed so much when the author pointed how similar Owen is to Harry Osborn, I was thinking the exact same thing! But I truly hope Owen gets a redemption, my favorite moments of him was when his mask slipped.<br/><br/>and Seth. Nice little Seth. God I love him SO much he's easily becoming one of my favorite book characters he's truly the best person there is and he was so cute crushing on Nick i swear to god I just want to kiss him on the cheek (platonically). Also he's the strongest character in the history of books. Imagine your crush making a self insert slightly horny fanfic of your mortal enemy who BY THE WAY is also making out with your crush and having to BETA READ THAT !!! how is seth still sane<br/><br/>Anyways I should stop on my Seth loving rant. I can't wait to read the second book! I heard the copaganda will stop, which is really good because it was very annoying and I am very curious about how Nick will find out about his powers and how that will affect his relationship with his dad and even his mom. <br/><br/>4.5/5 maybe :)? very fun and made me feel really good.<br/><br/>(PD: could not get tired of the spiderman references! love a fellow spiderman & andrew garfield stan ",

   "My Review": "Was experiencing reader's block and this took me out of it! I needed something light and entertaining and this was just it. It's so much better than the movie and it made me love all the characters a lot more. The movie is missing a lot of explanations of why the characters act the way they do, and it changes stuff that are essential for a character's development. I liked this a lot more.<br/><br/>About the book itself, I loved the different styles of writing of each character. At first I was scared I'd get confused, but the great writing made me realize who was narrating according to each character's distinct writing. There's nothing I loved more about the book than the narration of the biggest moments for Lemonade Mouth, which are not narrated through their eyes, but through the witnesses' eyes. <br/><br/>I really recommend it if you're looking for something light and fun.",

   "My Review": "I really don't know how to rate this.<br/><br/>It's a book that tries <i> so </i> hard to be deep and different it annoys me. No, Tori, you're not like other girls.<br/><br/>I don't know if the point was to make Tori unlikeable. I almost stopped reading until i got to the second half. There, Tori realizes she needs to do something, <i> to be better </i>. I thought she'd get a great character development, so I stuck around. However... she does nothing and she still believes she's not like other girls.<br/><br/>I mean, she tries! but the characters still get in her way. It was Michael, not her, who found out who Solitaire is. It was Becky, not her, who stood up to them. She didn't even have the chance to save the fire ?!! Give her some utility??<br/><br/>There was plenty. A lot. Of situations where Tori was straight up awful and unlikeable. I wouldn't mind if that was the point, not all main characters should be likeable. But the book tries so hard to make us have empathy for her it's laughable.<br/><br/>Talking about laughable. The amount of times she laughs and cries when something goes wrong? I felt like I was reading the same page over and over. Why does she laugh so much idgi ",

   "My Review": "<b>Pride Month reading #2: <i> gay mc, bi mc, mlm couple ; Young Adult (romance) </i></b><br/><br/>What a glow up! I liked this so much more than solitaire, probably because I'm biased and I like happy books more. Yeah, it was a bit sad sometimes but I'd mostly consider it a happy book!<br/><br/>It was lovely seeing how much they care for and love each other and reading their relationship grow. I think they can set a really good example for all couples about talking things out and changing your relationship for the best. Change isn't always bad. A lot of times change can mean growth.<br/><br/>The POVs changes were a bit messy sometimes but I could clearly see the difference between narrations and personalities. I really liked that. <br/><br/>New comfort book added! 4.75/5<br/><br/><i> \"No, but—\" he shakes his head — \"you're Nick and Charlie.\"<br/>I laugh. \"What does that mean?\"<br/>\"It's...\" He laughs too, a nervous expulsion of air. \"You're... it's hard to explain. <b> It's like, if you had to provide evidence for soul mates, everyone would pick you two.\" </b> </i><br/><br/><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8OuA14X4AAVy0h.jpg\"/>",

It's a must-read for every Love Live fan. It explains a lot about Maki's relationship with her parents and how that shaped her to who she is today. It's very sad, but I'm happy it goes its way to highlight Maki is better now.<br/>5/5 I loved it.",

   "My Review": "Cómo se nota que fue escrito por un hombre. La idea de la Interperie estaba buena, y fue implementada bastante bien hasta Martín Fierro. Desde ahí fue cualquier cosa. El asesinato/desaparición de personajes secundarios una vez que dejan de servir un propósito es tan brutalmente obvio como molesto, Cata era el mejor personaje y uno de los mejor desarrollados y en una sóla línea desaparece ??<br/><br/>Lo mismo con la muerte de Alejandro, Alejandro era algo que ella guardaba de su otra vida y que esperaba a verlo para volver a lo que era antes de la Interperie, pero María se entera que lo matan y se queda como \"Ah, bue, que pena. Bueno entonces....\" Señor Pedro Mairal me tuve que comer 800 menciones de Alejandro para éste momento.<br/><br/>La historia no tiene mucha continuidad, y los capítulos están cortados de una forma para que no te des cuenta. Entiendo que deben representar las diferentes Marías, pero parece una colección de cuentos.<br/><br/>¿Por qué el final abierto encima? No sólamente esto, sino que el capítulo final se siente bastante apresurado. Es una combinación de bastantes coincidencias inexplicables. Ah, mirá vos, justo es el edificio que trabajaba, justo aparece Bairos, justo la deja vivir por razones que no entendemos en lo absoluto, justo aparece Suárez muerto, justo tiene el vestido, ¿Y todo eso, más el final, en un capítulo? Es cómo si el autor no sabía cómo terminar el libro.<br/><br/>En los puntos buenos, pre Martín Fierro fue bastante interesante. Especialmente los capítulos del Hospital y el Bar. La crítica a aquellas personas que viven por la televisión estuvo increíble, por eso la primera mitad del libro se llevó el premio. La segunda... eh, medio cualquier cosa.<br/><br/>Gente ha sacado mejores fanfics que ésto.<br/><br/><br/>2/5",

   "My Review": "<i> \"Because I want everybody in the audience to hear you\" </i> GO KING GO!!<br/><br/>I liked The Sea of Monsters a lot more than the The Lightning Thief! Not that The Lighting Thief was bad, it was very much enjoyable, but since this one focused in one goal <i>(getting the Fleece)</i> it was much lighter and easier to go through.<br/><br/>Not only that, but it was much happier than the first one. You can see how much Annabeth and Percy love each other, and seeing Percy grow and accept his brother was just as adorable as Tyson himself. While Grover didn't play as much of a part in this book compared to the past one, the story of this book completely revolves around him and I loved how it's connected with The Lighting Thief. I didn't thought Grover's quest would be a big plot point, but I'm glad that it was. The character development of this book was exceptional, specially for Annabeth. We only get to see her through Percy's eyes, but in this book we got a little of her own perspective as well. It was great.<br/><br/>The plot twists improved a lot compared to the past book. They were all enjoyable and made sense. Luckily, most did not revealed too much information, almost none at all, making me curious of the next book.<br/><br/>My biggest and most current complain through both books was the same: Luke. You could remove him out or just replace him with a random person or Kronos himself and the plot would still make sense. He appears at the beginning to do... nothing. Just show you the coffin, which would definitely have a big impact on the future but it still isn't directly related to him (meaning anyone could've shown the coffin), and then he returns in the end (an eye rolling decision, by the way) to do. nothing again. Not even that, in the final battle with him, Rick decides to pull a Deus ex Machina with Chiron. You know, just the most infuriating trope there is. Dude just... appears out of nowhere. That chapter pissed me off to be honest....<br/><br/>But it luckily it didn't forbid me to still enjoy the other parts of the books! I got plenty of good laughs and a great time reading it. I'll definitely re-read it one day.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars.",

   "My Review": "A very enjoyable first volume! <br/><br/>As much of a shock it was to see Gwen pursuing music instead of science, it gave us some very fun moments like MJ getting accused of wanting to go solo or... <i>superstar soloist Felicia? </i> (By the way, I LOVED Felicia's design)<br/><br/>I also loved Gwen's and Peter's story. As much as I love Peter, him being <b>\"the spiderman sacrifice\"</b> was a great choice and how he saw Spider-Woman was really interesting, specially taking in count he's the main Spider-Man (of the multiverses).<br/><br/>The story was a bit confusing at times, but I could still understand anyways. The art style was really sharp and easy to follow too~<br/><br/>Gwen is a great Spider-Woman and <i>Evil!</i> Daredevil is really entertaining. They both got me laughing at times.<br/><br/>Very good volume! Love U Spider-Gwen <3",

   "My Review": "Re-read it once again, one of my favorite series, probably my fav actually. I love how this takes the view of (very likely neurodivergent) kids in abuse. It's lovely how they interact with each other, it may seem odd to some people, but I love it.<br/><br/>As always, can't highlight how much I appreciate Lemony Snicket as a character (and as an author as well, of course) I love when he gives definitions of words, helping me expand my english vocabulary since I was kid due to the fact I'm a non-native speaker, and also giving his own opinions and facts about stuff happening in the book.<br/><br/>[spoiler] I also really like the little details, like Al Funcoot being an anagram and how the book, since chapter one, makes you pay attention to the fact that Violet is right-handed.<br/><br/>(Not) enjoyable as always and a super easy reading.<br/><br/>5/5",

   "My Review": "Something that made me read this book so fast and be so into it is that it really looked like Charlie was talking to me. He felt like a friend.<br/><br/>I really liked the letter format, it was different from what I've read, and it felt personal. I didn't mind the bad grammar there was sometimes, or how oblivious Charlie was at some stuff because I think that added to the realism of what Charlie was: a 15 (and later 16) teenager.<br/><br/>I loved how caring Charlie is, it was lovely to see him worrying for everyone's well-being.<br/><br/>I think I'll really miss this book, I'll give it a re-read one day.",

   "My Review": "Before starting the review I want to say this book really needed trigger warnings. The ones I found are:<br/>ableism, rape, nsfw and explicit attempt to suicide.<br/><br/>Now, to the review:<br/><br/>Well... I'm disappointed.<br/><br/>I read this all in one day at school. The first half really got me and I couldn't stop reading. The second half? I was just reading it to get it over with.<br/><br/>The first red flag was the amount of ableism, god. Someone here already pointed it out, but they were told to read the entire book before judging. Well, I did, and I still think that amount of ableism wasn't justified at all. Not even for character grow.<br/><br/>I didn't really mind the character was just some dude named Jeff, until it's revealed why he killed himself and wow, that was kind of boring, not going to lie. The attempt itself was too explicit and glorifying, I get that's the point, but they should've used trigger warnings. The motive itself was boring, specially since the thing that made me finish the book in a go was to know why he did it.<br/><br/>\"When did this became a gay coming out book?\" I asked myself while reading Jeff practicing coming out to his parents. I knew this had LGBT+ rep, it was even one of the reasons why I read it, but the rep was kind of awful.<br/><br/>When the dude, whose name I already forgot, came to the hospital I thought \"oh, so this must be the man that's going to make this book gay\", but when he was finally described I was caught off guard, I don't know if it was the point, but I don't know, it felt weird.<br/>And then come on, THREE rape scenes? it's crazy.<br/><br/>[spoilers (?)] Ignoring how problematic that is + the fact Jeff killed himself because all gay people are depressed I guess! (sarcasm), I didn't really liked it all circled back to him being depressed over being gay or whatever because it wasn't settled in the first half. The first half is supossed to give the basis for the second half, yet this didn't even gave a hint. I would definitely not mind if it wasn't the focus of it all, and I'm not saying this because of the rep, but because of the writing itself. (sorry i sound homophobic byee i swear im not ",

   "My Review": "So, the first thing I thought when I first opened the book was the narration, first person in the present. Now, I'm used to reading books with omniscient narrators, even if it's overused, it's my favorite type of narration, so I wasn't sure if I'd like the writing of the book. I didn't, and I still don't, think it was the best choice for narrating. Since then my follow-up thought was, how would any of them have done it if we're reading their thoughts as they go by....? Boom, four suspects down and I had barely started the book.<br/><br/>Maybe it'd have been better first person in the past, people can lie there, people can't lie to their own thoughts immediately and unconsciously.<br/><br/>I did liked, though, Addy's character. As a person who's most similar to Brownyn, but not as half as smart as her, I always wondered how people like Addy are in their daily lives, outside of school. At first, it was just what I expected, but once Jake brokes up with her is where she really gets interesting. She was the best character in my opinion and the highlight of the book.<br/><br/>Cooper was ok, I felt bad for him, but before the gay announcement I was getting tired of baseball talk. He didn't really give much to the plot if I'm being honest, just the token gay character I guess...? <br/><br/>Brownyn.... it seemed like Brownyn was a bit difficult? I really loved whenever she wasn't narrating her moments with Nate, when she had her smart moments and when she talked about how much she loved her sister. But when she was narrating Nate... she felt out of character sometimes. Like when she was at the mall with Nate and he got mad (for something that, in my opinion, Brownyn was right) and she immediately asked him to forgive her...? I don't know, it wouldn't seem like Brownyn would've done that. (By the way the criminal and the brain dating plot... I don't know if the cliché was on purpose or not). Also whenever she talked about cheating in chemistry I felt like throwing up, I know it was a big deal for her but come on! I accepted it at the beginning because we hadn't reached the character development yet, but once we did, she still acted like it was worse than murder or something. It was annoying, ngl.<br/><br/>I liked Nate. It was obvious he didn't do it (without counting the narration type) because he didn't cared enough about Simon when he was alive. As much of a cliché it is, I like the good heart criminal who just wants to maintain himself. On the opposite from Brownyn, his narrations about her were heartwarming and on point. However whenever he believed he was cooler than what he was... like that narration on the juvenile... yeah, I've never cringed so hard, but he was probably the second best character of the book.<br/><br/>When 4Chan came to question i actually laughed. I don't know why, but everytime it's mentioned I can't take it seriously.<br/><br/>And for the lovely plot twist... Simon was depressed and killed himself! Dragging his classmates around, his best friend, and his ex friend, who was more than happy to help.<br/><br/>I don't know why, I hated it. I'm a very picky person with endings, I know they're hard to do, but I always expect the best from a writer. The ending of a book can either make me like the book a lot, even if the development sucked, or dislike it a lot, even if the development was good. That was an exaggeration, I don't dislike this book but it did disappoint me. Yes, there was some clues about it (like 4Chan, but again, I couldn't take it seriously) that you could only connect knowing who did it, but the fact we spent the entire time looking for the killer to find out he's dead....? I don't know, it feels anti-climatic, and, not going to lie, I hated how depression was portrayed here. Like if them being depressed would mean something, it meant something for Simon, yes, but it wasn't depression that led him to that, it was his twisted head. The trope that depressed people kill themselves as a revenge is already done by 13 reasons why and it's harmful as fuck, please stop. I also disliked Jake as a last minute villain. He was entertaining, let's say, but appeared at the last second and it was kind of random. Tho, maybe this would have hit harder if I thought of this book as a story of how these four teenagers' lives, with different types of secrets, gets twisted after they witness a murder (or a suicide), rather than think of it as story of finding the killer, because at the end of the day I don't think that was the highlight of the book, but how their lives change after being suspects, and I know that's probably what the writer intended, specially with making Simon \"the killer\", but since the book was promoted in a different way, I couldn't enjoyed it as much as I want to. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, this is a personal review, mostly how the book made me feel and not more about how it is, the book was ok, even enjoyable sometimes, but not as much as I wanted to.",

   "My Review": "This one was a bit harder to rate. So, I'll review through chapters.<br/><br/>- NicoMaki's chapter: It was so cute. I'm a huge NicoMaki fan. When Nico broke down in tears because Maki left her alone I really felt those two were bonding even more, I love them.<br/><br/>- NozoRin's chapter: One of the best. Nozomi is the best character in my opinion and her love for µ's is one of the best things in the group. Rin was super adorable here.<br/><br/>- Hanayo's chapter: Now this is where I found it hard to rate. I thought this chapter would end with Hanayo having higher self esteem, since the problem of this chapter was Hanayo's low confidence, but nothing happened? I found it weird. Hanayo deserves better.<br/><br/>- Rin's chapter: This was nice, in a story way, but way too sad. I wish it was happier.<br/><br/>- Maki's chapter: \"I never knew your heart could hurt from happiness\" How does every Maki chapter manage to make me feel so sad yet make my heart hurt from how much I love her... This chapter showed a bit more of Maki and I loved it. I can relate to her and some ways and this was super cute, I hope there's more chapters like these for the other girls in the next volume.<br/><br/>3.5/5",

I was heartbroken.<br/><br/>[spoiler] How Umi related to her and helped her go back to the group... yeah peak literature I think.<br/><br/>Yukiho's and Honoka's chapter was beautiful too. Way better than the anime version, you could see how much these sisters truly love each other. It was lovely.<br/><br/>School Idol Diaries is the best way to know the girls better, not the anime, not the manga, but this. Please give it a read!",

   "My Review": "Oh boy, I finally finished this.<br/><br/>I didn't take much to finish, reading this book was almost all I did this week, but i was too curious to know how it ended. Evelyn always left you wanting for more, and I was really hooked on it.<br/><br/>Evelyn narrations were, unarguably, the best. Not going to lie, sometimes Monique's part of the made stop reading, or read too fast to get them over with. I liked how she applied what she learned from Evelyn to her life, but, compared to Evelyn, her life was too boring.<br/><br/>[major spoiler alert] I'm not quite sure I liked how Monique was related to Evelyn. It was way too obvious it was through Monique's dad, but I don't know... felt like it wasn't good enough, kind of random. It was nice to see that Monique's mom relationship with him was a parallel to Evelyn's with Harry. <br/><br/>Something I really liked about this book was how Evelyn explored her sexuality. From seeing it to a tool to get something from it, to something she loved to enjoy with the love of her life.<br/><br/>[spoiler] The last part of the book, when Evelyn was already retired and with Celia, was just ok... some parts were nice but I already accepted she wouldn't be seeing Celia again. I loved their relationship, but I was kind of done by the last bit of the book tbh... still, I really liked Celia and both she and Evelyn had some points.<br/><br/>Evelyn wasn't perfect, that's the whole point of the book and that's what she wants us to know, so of course this left me a bit of a bitter taste once I finished it, since it was the first time in a while when I wasn't rooting for the main character, but I really enjoyed reading this and would probably give it a re-read someday. <br/><br/>4.25?/5",

   "My Review": "Just finished reading and I have mixed feelings. I enjoyed it, most of the time, but there's a lot of stuff that I didn't liked too.<br/><br/>I think my biggest problem with the book is how ambitious it is, there's a lot of new characters and new experiences, but not enough pages to develop them correctly. Take Rajeev for example, I loved the idea of Mo getting to meet someone that could relate to her experiences, but in just a few pages they leave that behind to make him Stella's romantic interest! In my opinion, she didn't needed one, and I couldn't buy that either, I don't think it was explained enough how important Rajeev was to Lemonade Mouth. When he left, it definitely didn't feel like a part of Lemonade Mouth leaving, but it did feel like a very good character that I liked leaving.<br/><br/>I also disliked the amount of anticipation phrases there were in the book (Like, \"We didn't know how much [blank] would affect us later\") and Charlie's three years later povs. At first I'd die to know what happened, but by the tenth time i was kinda done.<br/><br/>At last, the thing I enjoyed the most about Lemonade Mouth is how normal they just are. Just kids in highschool playing in a band. This book changed that, for nothing to ever happen. Not even the event that has been mentioned since the start of the book, Sista Slash's concert, happened for them. It was a bit annoying.<br/><br/>But on the bright side, let's talk about the things I liked.<br/><br/>I really liked Charlie's new narrations and the explanation of why it changed. It's really hard for me to imagine stuff so I enjoyed everytime Charlie narrated since it made everything easier.<br/><br/>I also loved Wen in this book. He used to be my least favorite character, just because I liked the others more, but in this book he showed how caring he is and how much he grew from the first book. His relationship with Olivia was probably my favorite part of the book.<br/><br/>I wish they would've spent more time on Ray. It was interesting to see how he lived and how he interacted with Lemonade Mouth when he realized he was safe.<br/><br/>Would I recommend reading it if you liked the first one? Yes. Not because of what happens in the book, but to see how much the characters grew since the first book.  I still prefer the first one by a lot, but I still liked this one.<br/><br/>2.5/5",

   "My Review": "The Boy with the Cuckoo-Clock Heart is the first book I read with love as the main plot. It was weird, but in a good way, and the descriptions were beautiful.<br/><br/>It was kind of a tough start for me, specially with this being my first love book. I didn't really know where the plot was going or where the climax would be. I definitely got confused when they got together, but weirdly, that's when the book really starts going. The beginning of the end is when the book really started getting my attention, I finished it quickly once everything started going wrong.<br/><br/>The last chapter was interesting. I liked how Méliès made a book about Jack's story, just like he said, but I'm not really sure I liked that he wasn't in the final chapter. He was a really good character and introducing a new one at the end was just . meh. The epilogue wasn't really necessary for me so I'll stay with the last chapter's ending which was really good to me.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 3/5. Good reading, I liked it. Might read it again someday.",
